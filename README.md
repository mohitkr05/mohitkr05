Hi there! My name is [Mohit](http://mohitkr.com) and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’ve always been passionate about technology, infrastructure, and security and I’ve spent years honing my skills and knowledge in this field.

From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by technology. Whether I was tinkering with my desktop, breaking and fixing my laptop, or exploring the latest gadgets, I’ve always been drawn to the endless possibilities and transformations that technology offers. Over time, I’ve developed a deep understanding of how technology works, how it has evolved, and how it continues to shape our world. This passion and expertise have inspired me to pursue a career in IT and Telecom and to share my knowledge and insights with others who share my love of technology.
